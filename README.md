The School Bus Routing Problem (SBRP) is a combinatorial optimization problem that involves designing efficient routes for school buses to transport students between their homes (or designated bus stops) and schools. The primary goal is to minimize costs, such as the total distance traveled or the number of buses required, while adhering to constraints like safety, time, and capacity.
